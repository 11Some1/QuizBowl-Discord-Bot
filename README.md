# Credits:
- This bot would not be possible without [DV8FromTheWorld](https://github.com/DV8FromTheWorld)'s [Java Discord API](https://github.com/DV8FromTheWorld/JDA), allowing me to connect my Java code to Discord.
- The backbone of this bot's services was lifted heavily by Google Cloud Platform's [Speech-to-Text](https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text) and [Text-to-Speech](https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech) APIs, which was then connected to Discord through [widavies](https://github.com/widavies)' [VocalCord](https://github.com/widavies/VocalCord) API. 
- I also used the [Apache PDFBox API](https://pdfbox.apache.org/) to easily convert PDFs to text.
