# Installation
Currently, this is a self-hosted bot â€” meaning you will need to host and maintain your own instance of it. (Perhaps later, I will maintain a public version of this bot.)

The following are the steps to take to set this bot up yourself:

### Part 1: Discord Bot
1) Download the repository and save it wherever you plan on hosting the bot.
   - Make sure your directory stuff is correct.
      - Gradle should reconfigure most of the directory stuff for you, but you should check the ```build.gradle``` file to make sure it is pointing stuff in the right direction.
      - In line 32 of ```Bot.java```, make sure that the file paths for ```jniLocation:```, ```porcupineLocation:```, ```porcupineParams:```, and ```...wakePhrasePaths:``` are correct specific to your directories.
3) Go to the [Discord Developer Console](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and click "New application".
4) On the left sidebar, select "Bot".
5) Click "Add Bot"
6) Press "Click to Reveal Token" and copy the listed token.
7) Go to ```Bot.java``` and paste the token from Step 5) in place of ```[YOUR BOT TOKEN HERE]```.
8) On the left sidebar, select "OAuth2".
9) Under "Scopes", check off "bot".
10) Under "Bot permissions", select the permissions you wish to give the bot.
   - At minimum, you will need to give the bot the following permissions:
     - ```Connect```
     - ```Speak```
     - ```Use Voice Activity```
     - ```Send Messages```
     - ```Read Message History```
   - Alternatively, you can give the bot ```Administrator``` and be done with it, although depending on the server you might not want to or be allowed to do so.
11) After Step 9), Discord will auto generate a link to you. Go to that address. From there, you will be able to select which server you'd like to add the bot to.
    - I recommend setting up a new private server to set up the bot up on before implementing it on a different server, for reasons revealed in the next step...
      - To do so, press the green plus button on the left sidebar on the normal Discord window (```Add a server```), then click ```Create a server```, input whatever server name you want and then finally click ```Create```.

### Part 2: Google APIs
This part of the guide is copied over from [widavies](https://github.com/widavies)' [VocalCord API](https://github.com/widavies/VocalCord) page on GitHub. 

1) Navigate to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) website.
2) In the lop left, select the projects drop down and create a new project.
3) Once your project is created, click the "APIs & Services" card.
4) From here, select the "Dashboard" tab on the left sidebar, click "Enable APIs and Services."
5) Search for and enable ```Cloud Speech-to-Text API``` and ```Cloud Text-to-Speech API```.
6) On the left sidebar, select "Credentials", then under "Service Accounts", selected "Manage service accounts". Give your service account a name, and everything at its default. You will need to click the "Create Key" button, make sure JSON is selected, and hit "Create". This will download a JSON file. This is your credentials for using Google APIs, keep it secret! Save it to a location where you will remember where it is.
7) On Windows, open the start menu and search "Edit the system environment variables". Click "Environment Variables" and under System Variables, click "New".
   - For "Variable name", enter ```GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS```.
   - For "Variable value", enter the path to your Google Credentials JSON, for example: ```C:\Users\abcde\Documents\Programming Projects\API.json```. It does not matter where you put this .json file on your system, as long as the PATH points correctly to it.

# Limitations
- The single biggest limitation is that VocalCord does not seem to handle multithreading very well. Essentially what that means is that when the bot is outputting text-to-speech, it cannot be interrupted without stopping the process (ie, the thread) entirely. Once that is done, you can't go back to where you left off in the thread.
  - This makes implementing multiplayer very difficult.
  - This also makes it hard to support more than one instance of the ```Bot``` at a time (which means that it can only handle requests from one server at a time.)
- There are no bonuses, and negs always apply (even if the question has been finished reading.)
- Currently, you have to host the PDF from your local server.

# Roadmap
Upcoming features/changes (hopefully):
- Implement loading Scholar's Bowl packets into the bot directly from website URL, rather than having to download the PDF onto your local machine.
- Fix scoring (add bonuses & fix negs.)
- Add more comments to ```Bot.java```.
- Host a version of this bot myself.

# Credits:
- This bot would not be possible without [DV8FromTheWorld](https://github.com/DV8FromTheWorld)'s [Java Discord API](https://github.com/DV8FromTheWorld/JDA), allowing me to connect my Java code to Discord.
- The backbone of this bot's services was lifted heavily by Google Cloud Platform's [Speech-to-Text](https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text) and [Text-to-Speech](https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech) APIs, which was then connected to Discord through [widavies](https://github.com/widavies)' [VocalCord API](https://github.com/widavies/VocalCord). 
- I also used the [Apache PDFBox API](https://pdfbox.apache.org/) to easily convert PDFs to text.
